  <span>B. IP ADDRESS, COOKIES & MOBILE IDENTIFIERS 
</span>   
<p>We may collect certain information through technology like cookies, pixels and local storage (like on your browser or device). Cookies are small text files that store information on your computer, mobile phone or other device locally. Pixels are small images that are part of codes on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure viewing of a webpage and often are used in connection with cookies. The code trackes if and when (and on which page) a pixel is loaded to indicate that a user has engaged with a specific screen or portion of a screen. With the help of cookies, the web server can save, for instance, preferences and settings on the user\'s computer, mobile phone or other device which are then automatically restored on the next visit. Or to put it another way, the cookies are used, among other things, to make the use of the site more user-friendly so that, for instance, you do not have to repeat the log-in process when you visit again. We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Whereas persistent cookies remain on your computer for a longer period of time, session cookies are automatically deleted when the browser window is closed. We may allow third parties such as advertising or analytics providers to collect information using these types of technologies directly on our website or from our mobile application. The data that they collect is subject to the applicable privacy policy of those third parties.</p>
